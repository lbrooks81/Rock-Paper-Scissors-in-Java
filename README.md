CP132 Homework 4

In this homework, you’ll get some practice in writing loops, writing pseudocode and drawing
flowcharts.

Specifications
Rock, paper, scissors is a children’s game where two players simultaneously make the shape of a rock,
paper, or scissors with their hands. A player who plays rock would beat a player who plays scissors, a
player who plays scissors would beat a player who plays paper, and a player that plays paper would
beat a player who plays rock. If two players play the same thing, it results in a draw.

The player will be allowed to input either rock, paper, or scissors and the opposing player’s choice will
be randomly chosen. Output to the player whether or not they won, lost, or drew.

The game should be a best-of-five scenario. A player will need to win three games to win the match.
Games resulting in a draw should not be considered.

(10 pts) Design the logic for the game by drawing a flowchart and writing pseudocode.
(10 pts) Program the rock, paper, scissors game you designed.

Constraints
 Prompt the user before every input.
◦ Ex: “Enter a either ...: ”
 Echo every input.
◦ Ex: “Rock beats scissors.”
 The logic to prompt the user and then get their input should be in its own method.
 The logic that randomly generates the opposing player’s choice should be in its own method.
 The logic that calculates who won or loss should be in its own method.
 Declare variables before using them.
 (Code only) Close the input Scanner when there are no more inputs.

Extra Credit Opportunity (for code only)
 (1 pt) Validate the user’s input. If a user types in something that isn’t “rock”, “paper”, or
“scissors” (or any other inputs you allow), prompt the user to input again.
◦ In your reprompt, make sure you make it clear what you expect from the user.

Scoring Rubric (for code only)
10/10 Program meets specifications.
9-6/10 Program does not meet specifications but there was noticeable effort.
5-0/10 Program does not meet specifications and there was little effort put in.

Submission
The submission for this homework is the commit ID you want to be graded, the flowchart, and the
pseudocode. You will submit them via the Canvas assignment.

Submit only one vsdx file for your flowcharts. Utilize multiple pages.

Submit only one text file for your pseudocode. Before your pseudocode, make it clear which
problem your pseudocode is for. Acceptable file formats for your pseudocode: txt, pdf, docx, doc, odt

You may put the two files in an archive file. Acceptable archive file types: zip, 7z, rar, tar, tar.gz

Failure to follow submission instructions will result in lost points.
